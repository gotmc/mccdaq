Go library to communicate with Measurement Computing Corporation (MCC)
USB DAQs. Based on [Dr. Warren J. Jasper][jasper]'s [MCC DAQ C-based
drivers][mcc-linux]. Many thanks to Dr. Jasper for his work.

**WARNING:** This code is in active development and should not be
considered a stable API. Currently, it is not idomatic GO code, but I
hope to change that in the near future.

## Supported MCC Devices

Below is a list of supported MCC devices. If you want to add a device,
please open an issue. Better yet, please open a pull request with the
updated code.

- [USB-1608FS-Plus][]: Digital I/O and event counter not yet
  implemented.
- [USB-200 Series][usb-20x]: Digital I/O, analog output, and 32-bit
  counter not yet implemented. Not yet tested on an actual [USB-20X][]
  device.

## Contributing

[mccdaq][] is developed using [Scott Chacon][]'s [GitHub Flow][]. To
contribute, fork [mccdaq][], create a feature branch, and then
submit a [pull request][].  [GitHub Flow][] is summarized as:

- Anything in the `master` branch is deployable
- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of
  `master` (e.g., `new-oauth2-scopes`)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same
  named branch on the server
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for
  merging, open a [pull request][].
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can
  merge it into master.
- Once it is merged and pushed to `master`, you can and *should* deploy
  immediately.

## Testing

Prior to submitting a [pull request][], please run:

```bash
$ gofmt
$ golint
$ go vet
$ go test
```

To update and view the test coverage report:

```bash
$ go test -coverprofile coverage.out
$ go tool cover -html coverage.out
```
